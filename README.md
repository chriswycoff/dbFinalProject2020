Final Project for Database Class

Zeke's update as of 5:30pm 11/21:
Tentative plan is to have Person ssns 123-142 be Candidates and 143-182 be Voters
I believe all tables not relying on foreign keys are populated-- next is to populate
Candidate, Voter, and vote tables.

Zeke's update as of noon 11/22:
Candidate and Voter tables filled in-- next is to populate
Vote, Candidate Vote, and Measure Vote

I have added a few example Votes that are all Measure Votes-- I am sometimes skipping voters in measure votes and each voter does not necessarily vote on all measures.
Once the Votes for Measure Votes are done, I will move onto the Candidate Votes so we can properly keep track of which voters have voted for what (I am doing everything in order once for measures and again for candidates). Again, Voters won't necessarily vote for all positions, but it will be worth making sure they aren't voting twice for the same position or person.

Zeke's update as of 3:30pm 11/22:
Measure Votes and related Votes done. Need to add Candidate Votes and related Votes.

Zeke's update as of 5:30pm 11/23:
Should be done entering data. There are no voters who voted for the same measure or position twice, but most voters did not vote for every measure or every position.
