Final Project for Database Class

Zeke's update as of 5:30pm 11/21:
Tentative plan is to have Person ssns 123-142 be Candidates and 143-182 be Voters
I believe all tables not relying on foreign keys are populated-- next is to populate
Candidate, Voter, and vote tables.

Zeke's update as of noon 11/22:
Candidate and Voter tables filled in-- next is to populate
Vote, Candidate Vote, and Measure Vote
