Currently working on queries to later adapt to the PHP pages that will be
displaying the info:


Query 1: Select the vote totals for each position (query by position name)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT CONCAT(x.fname, ' ', x.lname) AS fullname, x.pos_name, x.votes
FROM (SELECT p.fname, p.lname, pos.pos_name, COUNT(*) AS votes
      FROM CandidateVote cv JOIN Candidate c ON c.Person_ssn=cv.Candidate_Person_ssn
                      JOIN Person p ON cv.Candidate_Person_ssn=p.ssn
                      JOIN Position pos ON pos.pos_id=c.Position_pos_id
      GROUP BY cv.Candidate_Person_ssn) x
WHERE x.pos_name='President'
ORDER BY x.votes DESC


      Possible supplemental for Query 1: Show all positions that candidates are running for
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
      SELECT p.pos_name, p.description
      FROM Position p


Query 2: Select the vote totals for each measure (query by measure id)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT x.measure_id, x.yes_no, COUNT(*) as votes
FROM (SELECT m.measure_desc, m.measure_id, mv.yes_no
      FROM MeasureVote mv JOIN Measure m ON mv.Measure_measure_id=m.measure_id
      WHERE mv.Measure_measure_id=1061) x
GROUP BY x.yes_no
ORDER BY votes DESC


      Possible supplemental for Query 2: Show all measures on the ballot
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
      SELECT *
      FROM Measure m


Query 3: Total votes for each party (displayed with party name)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT p.party_name, COUNT(*)
FROM CandidateVote cv JOIN Candidate c ON cv.Candidate_Person_ssn=c.Person_ssn
					  JOIN Party p ON c.Party_party_code=p.party_code
GROUP BY p.party_name


------------- 3 and 4 are similar outputs ---------------


Query 4: Percentage of total votes by party (displayed with party name)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT p.party_name, ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CandidateVote), 2) AS Popular_vote_percentage
FROM CandidateVote cv JOIN Candidate c ON cv.Candidate_Person_ssn=c.Person_ssn
					  JOIN Party p ON c.Party_party_code=p.party_code
GROUP BY p.party_name


Query 5: Find all voters who registered in a particular year (use text field, not dropdown)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT CONCAT(p.fname, ' ', p.lname) AS fullname, CAST(v.reg_date AS Date) AS reg_date
FROM Voter v JOIN Person p ON v.Person_ssn=p.ssn
WHERE YEAR(v.reg_date)=2018


Query 6: Show all voters of a particular party (query by party name)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT CONCAT(p.fname, ' ', p.lname) AS fullname, pa.party_name, CAST(v.reg_date AS Date) AS reg_date
FROM Voter v JOIN Party pa ON v.Party_party_code=pa.party_code
			 JOIN Person p ON v.Person_ssn=p.ssn
WHERE pa.party_name LIKE 'Birthday'


      Possible supplemental for Query 6: Show all party names
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
      SELECT p.party_name
      FROM Party p
      ORDER BY p.party_name ASC
